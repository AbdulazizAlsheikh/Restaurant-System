# Restaurant System Project

## Description
This project is a restaurant management system designed as a part of a Data Structures course. It utilizes various data structures such as queues, stacks, and trees to manage virtual restaurant operations efficiently. The system is developed in Java, showcasing the ability to apply complex data structures in solving real-world problems.

## Features
- Order Management: Utilizes queues to manage the order processing pipeline from order placement to delivery.
- Inventory Tracking:Employs trees for organizing inventory items in a structured manner, allowing for efficient search, add, and delete operations.
- Reservation System: Implements stacks to manage orders, allowing for easy addition and cancellation.

## Installation
To set up the restaurant system on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-system.git
    cd restaurant-system
    ```

2. Compile Java Code
    ```bash
    javac RestaurantSystem.java
    ```

3. Run the Application
    ```bash
    java RestaurantSystem
    ```

## Usage
After running the application, you will be able to:
- Add, remove, or modify orders from the order queue.
